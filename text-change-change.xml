    <en-US>In the middle of the day, your dog comes barreling through the court, caterwauling and whimpering as it runs between courtiers and skids on the stone floors. Gasps of exclamation fill the air as your dog charges across the room, leaps into your lap and spins around before dropping into your lap and licking your face affectionately.
A harried servant rushes into the court. "My apologies, my {TITLE-0}. The dog startled several camels. {CHARACTER-1} was thrown from {G1:his:her} camel and chased the dog across the courtyard." The servant bows again, distress plain upon their face.

    <it-IT>Nel bel mezzo della giornata, il vostro cane arriva a tutta velocità nella corte, emettendo suoni e mugolii mentre corre tra i cortigiani e sbanda sul pavimento di pietra. L'aria si riempie di esclamazioni quando il cane attraversa la stanza, vi salta in grembo e vi gira intorno prima di cadervi in braccio e leccarvi affettuosamente il viso.
Un servitore affannato si precipita nella corte. "Le mie scuse, mio {TITLE-0}. Il cane ha spaventato diversi cammelli. {CHARACTER-1} è stato sbalzato da {G1:his:her} cammello e ha inseguito il cane per tutto il cortile". Il servitore si inchina di nuovo, l'angoscia è evidente sul suo volto.

    <en-US>Your {UNIT-0} has moved onto a link(VEGETATION_TREES) Tile. link(UNIT_WORKER,2) can spend one link(YIELD_ORDERS,3) to cut down link(VEGETATION_TREES) with the  icon(REMOVE_TREES) button in the Actions panel on the left, and two link(YIELD_ORDERS) can be spent to fully clear the land. These actions both harvest link(YIELD_WOOD,1) and add it to your stockpile. The Tile in question does not have to be in your territory to  icon(REMOVE_TREES) cut down the link(VEGETATION_TREES).
Once cut down, link(VEGETATION_TREES) take some time to regrow. If you build an link(CONCEPT_IMPROVEMENT) on a link(VEGETATION_TREES,1) Tile, the link(YIELD_WOOD) is automatically harvested as the land is Cleared, all at the cost of three link(YIELD_ORDERS).

Non è necessario che la tessera in questione si trovi nel vostro territorio per poter icon(REMOVE_TREES) abbattere il link(VEGETATION_TREES).
Una volta abbattuto, il link(VEGETATION_TREES) impiega un po' di tempo per ricrescere. Se si costruisce un link(CONCEPT_IMPROVEMENT) su una tessera link(VEGETATION_TREES,1) il link(YIELD_WOOD) viene automaticamente raccolto quando il terreno viene ripulito, il tutto al costo di tre link(YIELD_ORDERS).

    <en-US>link(YIELD_GROWTH,1) is essential for expanding your Population and increasing the Yields of your Cities.

Each link(EFFECTCITY_CITIZEN) provides a small amount of link(YIELD_ORDERS,1) and can be converted into link(CONCEPT_SPECIALIST,1).  
Cities with high link(YIELD_GROWTH) train new Civilian Units like link(UNIT_SETTLER,2), link(UNIT_WORKER,2), and link(UNIT_SCOUT,2) more rapidly. While a City produces a Civilian Unit, its link(YIELD_GROWTH) bar no longer fills. link(UNIT_MILITIA) and link(UNIT_CONSCRIPT) Units are also produced with link(YIELD_GROWTH) instead of link(YIELD_TRAINING,1) like other Military Units.
You can increase a City's link(YIELD_GROWTH) by training link(SPECIALIST_FARMER,2) and building link(IMPROVEMENT_GRANARY,2) and link(IMPROVEMENT_TOWN,2). link(IMPROVEMENT_FARM,2) will also augment link(YIELD_GROWTH) even further if built on resources like link(RESOURCE_WHEAT) or link(RESOURCE_BARLEY).

<p=SUBJECT_PLAYER_HITTITE>{G0:He:She} has been named {TITLE-0}, proclaiming {G0:his:her} rights to the ancestral lands of the {PLAYER-0,1}. Renowned as a child of their storm god, this new ruler could be a force to be wary of.
<else>{G0:He:She} has been empowered to lead the mighty {PLAYER-0} into the new age.
