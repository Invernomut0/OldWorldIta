Un ricco {PLAYER-1,1} ha acquistato terreni e bestiame a {PLAYER-2}, con il contratto scritto e sigillato da entrambe le parti. L'acquirente ha ricevuto solo bestiame di sesso maschile, sebbene il contratto preveda che in {p.is_sub.S1=SUBJECT_PLAYER_ASSYRIA:Aramaic:}{p.is_sub.S1=SUBJECT_PLAYER_BABYLONIA:Akkadian:}{p.is_sub.S1=SUBJECT_PLAYER_CARTHAGE:Punic:}{p.is_sub.S1=SUBJECT_PLAYER_EGYPT:Egyptian:}{p.is_sub.S1=SUBJECT_PLAYER_GREECE:Greek:}{p.is_sub.S1=SUBJECT_PLAYER_PERSIA:Persian:}{p.is_sub.S1=SUBJECT_PLAYER_ROME:Latin:}{p.is_sub.S1=SUBJECT_PLAYER_HITTITE:Hittite:} alcuni siano maschi e altri femmine. Il venditore {PLAYER-2,1} afferma che la sua copia del contratto {p.is_sub.S2=SUBJECT_PLAYER_ASSYRIA:Aramaic:}{p.is_sub.S2=SUBJECT_PLAYER_BABYLONIA:Akkadian:}{p.is_sub.S2=SUBJECT_PLAYER_CARTHAGE:Punic:}{p.is_sub.S2=SUBJECT_PLAYER_EGYPT:Egyptian:}{p.is_sub.S2=SUBJECT_PLAYER_GREECE:Greek:}{p.is_sub.S2=SUBJECT_PLAYER_PERSIA:Persian:}{p.is_sub.S2=SUBJECT_PLAYER_ROME:Latin:}{p.is_sub.S2=SUBJECT_PLAYER_HITTITE:Hittite:} riporta chiaramente solo bovini maschi.
Sembra che ci sia stato un problema di traduzione e che il contratto dica cose diverse in lingue diverse!</it-IT>
